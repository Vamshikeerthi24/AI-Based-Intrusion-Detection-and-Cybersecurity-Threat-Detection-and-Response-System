# AI-Based-Intrusion-Detection-and-Cybersecurity-Threat-Detection-and-Response-System
The project will develop an AI-powered platform for real-time detection of cybersecurity threats  and intrusions, incorporating automated responses to mitigate potential risks. The system will  utilize machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection and signature-based threat detection,  along with real-time monitoring dashboards.
